# psiphon-egress — Psiphon egress for an xray/remnawave node.
#
#   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtvworks/psiphon-egress/main/psiphon_install.sh)
#
# Derived from Chara-Freedom/vps-psiphon (MIT) — see CREDITS.md. What this copy
# adds over its parent: the default image is digest-pinned rather than :latest,
# the container carries memory/pids/log ceilings, `routing` prints the panel
# rules the outbound alone is useless without, and `verify` answers "is my SOCKS
# reachable from outside" in a way TCP-connect probes cannot.
#
# The tunnel runs as a container; its SOCKS5 is published on a host-private
# address and handed to xray through a four-line outbound. systemd owns the
# lifecycle, and a watchdog rotates the tunnel when the exit stops being usable.
#
# Installs:
#   /etc/default/vps-psiphon              parameters
#   /usr/local/sbin/vps-psiphon-run       container launcher (systemd ExecStart)
#   /usr/local/sbin/vps-psiphon-watchdog  liveness + burned-exit detector
#   /usr/local/sbin/vps-psiphon-advance-region  walks REGION_POOL on each rotation
#   /usr/local/sbin/vps-psiphon           management CLI
#   /etc/systemd/system/vps-psiphon.service
#   /etc/systemd/system/vps-psiphon-watchdog.service + .timer

#   /var/log/vps-psiphon-watchdog.log     watchdog journal
#   /var/lib/vps-psiphon-watchdog.state   watchdog counters
#
# `vps-psiphon uninstall` removes all of those, the container, the image and itself.

# Digest-pinned by default. The parent project ships :latest, which re-resolves on

  --region CC[,CC…]    egress country (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2). Empty = auto, the
                       fastest server in any country. Give several, comma-
                       separated, to form a POOL: every rotation advances to the
                       next country in it. That widens the server choice when one
                       country is congested, while keeping the exit inside a set
                       you chose — unlike auto, which may land on another
                       continent and cost you the latency. Available at the time
                       of writing: AT AU BE BR CA CH CZ DE DK ES FR GB ID IE IN
                       IT JP NL NO PL RS SE SG US
  --device-region CC   region the client reports. Cosmetic — the server decides
                       by GeoIP. Default: autodetected from this host.
  --socks-port N       SOCKS5 port for xray, default 1080. Refused if
                       taken — xray's outbound names this port, so moving it
                       behind your back would leave a tunnel nothing routes to.
  --http-port N        HTTP proxy port, default 8080. Nothing here
                       consumes it, so a taken default is moved to the next free
                       port; a port you name explicitly is refused instead.
  --no-http            do not publish the HTTP proxy at all. Remembered: a
                       later reinstall keeps it unpublished
  --http               publish it after all — undoes a stored --no-http, and
                       restores the proxy when an earlier run found no free port
  --deny-regions 'CC…' countries the exit must never be in, space or comma
                       separated. Default: RU BY IR SY CU KP CN VE. Unlike the
                       region and the pool, this is checked in EVERY mode — with
                       no --region and no OK_REGIONS it is the only country check
                       there is. An empty string disables it.
  --accept 'CC…'       countries Google's verdict may report, space or comma
                       separated. This is NOT the pool: the pool is what Psiphon
                       is asked for, this is what is accepted once Google has had
                       its say about the address it handed us. Default: everything
                       requested plus US, because Google rewrites many Psiphon
                       exits to US regardless of where they are, and that costs
                       nothing. Pass 'any' to accept every country and leave
                       --deny-regions as the only country check.
  --bind ADDR          host address to publish the SOCKS5 on. Default: the
                       docker0 gateway (usually 172.17.0.1). Publishing there
                       lets the kernel DNAT the traffic; publishing on loopback
                       cannot, so every byte is copied through docker-proxy in
                       userspace instead — 0.10 of a core sustained on a node
                       carrying ~100 new connections/s, 0.27-0.36 at peak. On a
                       1-core box that copy is the difference that matters.
                       Any address is accepted, a public one included; that is
                       your call, and the access control it then needs is yours.
  --bind-loopback      publish on 127.0.0.1 instead. Narrower — only processes
                       on the host reach it, whereas the gateway is also
                       reachable by containers on the default bridge — at the
                       price of that userspace copy. Neither address is
                       reachable from the internet.
  --image REF          container image
  --memory SIZE        container memory ceiling (default 512m)
  --pids-limit N       container pid ceiling (default 256), default swarupsengupta2007/psiphon:latest
  --no-watchdog        skip the watchdog

# Ignored once EGRESS_REGION or REGION_POOL is set — the verdict is then judged
# against ACCEPT_REGIONS below.
OK_REGIONS=$OLD_OK_REGIONS
# Countries the exit must NEVER be in, space separated. Checked before the allow-list
# and in every mode: with no EGRESS_REGION and no OK_REGIONS this is the only country
# check that runs at all. Those regions are where Google withholds service, the very
# failure this tool exists to escape — a false positive costs one rotation, a miss
# costs the service. Empty disables it.
DENY_REGIONS='$DENY_REGIONS'
# Minimum throughput, KB/s, read off the watchdog's own YouTube fetch — no extra
# traffic. Below this on FAIL_THRESHOLD of the last FAIL_WINDOW checks the tunnel is
# rotated: Psiphon picks its server per tunnel, so a bad pick otherwise persists while
# liveness and country both read green. 0 disables the gate.
#
# One floor for every node, on purpose: a number fitted by hand per machine is one
# nobody can reason about six months later. 800 came from replaying three nodes' own
# logged history (medians 1765 / 1987 / 3079 KB/s) through the window rule above — at
# 800 none of them would have rotated, at 1000 the slowest twice, at 1200 five times.
# Raising it buys nothing: a real collapse (66-128 KB/s while a healthy tunnel on the
# same box read 1500) trips the gate on the second check at 600 and at 1000 alike. The
# old default of 100 never fired at all, a working tunnel reading in the thousands.
#
# Lower it for a node that genuinely cannot reach it — after replaying that node's own
# throughput history from the watchdog log, not on one bad reading.
MIN_THROUGHPUT_KBPS=${OLD_MIN_THROUGHPUT:-800}
# Seconds after a container start during which the throughput gate is skipped. A
# freshly dialled tunnel is still ramping while every client the restart cut loose
# reconnects at once: the first check after a rotation read 73 KB/s on a tunnel that
# settled at 1500 a few minutes later, and judging it rotates a healthy tunnel
# away. It must be LONGER than the gap between checks or it protects nothing — the
# timer fires every 10 minutes, and the 300 this shipped with never once applied
# across three nodes. Liveness and country are still checked.
THROUGHPUT_GRACE_SEC=${OLD_GRACE:-900}
# Countries to rotate through, space separated. Empty = stay in EGRESS_REGION and only
# change server within it. Each rotation advances one entry, so a retry draws on a
# different country's servers instead of the same crowded set. Keep them near each
# other, and note the pool also feeds what the watchdog accepts: everything listed here
# you are accepting as a destination.
REGION_POOL='$REGION_POOL'
# Countries Google's verdict may report — deliberately NOT the same list as
# REGION_POOL. The pool is what Psiphon is asked for; this is what is accepted once
# Google has had its say about the address it handed us, and the two differ: Google
# rewrites many Psiphon exits to US whatever country the server reports, so judging the
# verdict against the request rotated healthy, fast exits away. Empty means the
# computed default — everything requested, plus US. The word any accepts every verdict.
# Sanctioned regions are rejected either way: deny is checked first.

# Rotation triggers, in order of how certain they are:
#   1. tunnel dead    — SOCKS does not answer.
#   2. denied country — Google places this exit in a sanctioned or Google-blocked
#      region. Checked first and in EVERY mode: under auto with no OK_REGIONS the
#      allow-list judges nothing, which is precisely when a sanctioned exit would go
#      unnoticed. The two lists are not alternatives — acceptable countries are a
#      closed, short set, dangerous ones an open one, so the latter is named and
#      checked unconditionally.
#   3. wrong country  — Google's verdict about this exit, published in YouTube's page
#      source as "GL":"XX", is not one we accept. This is what makes Cloudflare WARP
#      unusable for region-gated services: WARP reads back as the client's own
#      country. Not every mismatch weighs the same — Psiphon is used mostly from
#      America, so Google has reclassified many of its exits as US, which is harmless;
#      a rewrite to a sanctioned region is trigger 2.
#   4. stalled tunnel — SOCKS answers the liveness probe, yet no HTTP request through
#      the tunnel completes. Judged by the ABSENCE of a response, never by its size,
#      so a captcha page is not mistaken for a stall.
#   5. slow tunnel    — the exit answers from an accepted country but carries almost
#      nothing. Psiphon picks its server per tunnel, so a bad pick stays until
#      something forces a reconnect while liveness and country read green throughout;
#      without this gate a 30-90x collapse is invisible. Measured on the YouTube fetch
#      below, and skipped for THROUGHPUT_GRACE_SEC after a start while the tunnel is
#      still ramping.
#
# Google's /sorry captcha is recorded but never rotates on its own: a human solves one
# in seconds, and churning the tunnel over it costs more than it saves.

Paste into the panel's config profile (Remnawave: Config Profiles -> your profile).

OUTBOUND — alongside the existing DIRECT / BLOCK:

    { "tag": "psiphon-out", "protocol": "socks",
      "settings": { "address": "$BIND", "port": $SOCKS_PORT } }

RULES — order matters, first match wins:

    { "type": "field", "protocol": ["bittorrent"], "outboundTag": "BLOCK" },
    { "type": "field", "network": "udp", "port": "53", "outboundTag": "DIRECT" },
    { "type": "field", "network": "udp", "outboundTag": "BLOCK" },
    { "type": "field", "network": "tcp", "outboundTag": "psiphon-out" }

The two UDP lines are not optional. This SOCKS is TCP-only — psiphon answers UDP
ASSOCIATE with REP=7 COMMAND NOT SUPPORTED. Send UDP at it and DNS dies with
everything else; leave UDP DIRECT and QUIC/HTTP3 keeps succeeding outside the
tunnel, so half the traffic ignores it. Blocking UDP makes clients fall back to
TCP, which is the path that works. DNS is the one exception and goes DIRECT.

To tunnel only some destinations, replace the last rule and leave the rest direct:

    { "type": "field", "network": "tcp", "outboundTag": "psiphon-out",
      "domain": ["geosite:google", "openai.com"] }

Nothing here is applied for you: the panel owns the node's xray config, and a
config written on the node is overwritten on the next sync.
